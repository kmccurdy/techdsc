## Technological Sovereignty - Introduction - the big picture/vision 

We live in societies in which technological systems and the ways in which they are shaped and governed are powerful ways to shape society. Technology has become a central form of social power and it is urgent to democratise this power. Technological changes have been accelerating and the private sector has an increasing influence over the directions of these changes. However, it is becoming ever more clear that the concentration of capital driven technological change is detrimental to the flourishing of people and a healthy democracy. 

Democratising societies must include democratising its technologies. And democratising technologies can only be successful within an agenda to democratise societies. Digitalisation, energy and mobility systems, housing, the future of work, of our health, of freedom, of equality, of our public sphere, of cities, of the environment and of states and democracy – the shape and quality of all of this is entwined with technological changes. Combining the democratisation of societies with the democratisation of technologies is therefore not only about the need to regulate particular technologies to prevent harm. Democratising technology is about finding ways of democratically shaping and governing technologies for the common good, to bring technological power under democratic control and to use technological advances to benefit the many and to help societies and people flourish in the 21st century. 

### The undemocratic state of current technological change in Europe

The concentration of technological power, often in corporations, that translates into economic, political and cultural influence and directs the benefits of new technologies towards the few, the shareholders and capital owners. This is tightly entangled with financialised capitalism where investors shape technological change purely on a for maximum profit basis. 

The privatisation of knowledge and data, which monopolises collectively created ideas, capabilities, information and resources and feeds a regime of surveillance capitalism where data is "valuable" for creating tools to manipulate consumers. 

The extreme centralisation and concentration of influence over the World Wide Web, one of the most significant infrastructures of our society, through corporations and states. 

The technocratic decision making in research and politics where experts make decisions about shaping the future through research and innovation in intransparent and unaccountable ways. 

The narrow focus on "high-tech" technological innovation and economic growth that leaves out of sight social and cultural innovations and innovations that may not lead to maximum profit but to social well-being and significant ecological sustainability. 

The lack of diversity of people who do research, development and decision making in technology.

We propose policies that help to democratically shape the technologies that are such an important part of our lives, economies and societies. We propose to make use of the power of the public sector and of civil society to seed innovations and unleash their potential for social good.

- Which problems (for which we have solutions) to explicitly address here? 

### Towards technologies for the common good 

Technological development is not a goal in itself. Technology exists to serve human progress. DiEM25 firmly supports human rights in the face of technology – the flourishing of humans, all humans, comes first, and technology second. Conceived in this way, technological development can be a formidable force for good. Technology is a key contributor to our civilization’s ability to provide health, welfare, social interaction, freedom, safety and happiness. DiEM25 firmly supports sound and positive technological development that benefits mankind, and rejects Luddite anti-technological thinking. However, this does not mean that all technological development is good. And negative costs and consequences of technologies must be taken into account - it must no longer be the case that profits from new technologies are privatised and the risks are socialised. In the face of accelerating technological change we need to safeguard and extend our individual and collective self-determination to not lose control to the designers and owners of technological systems or even autonomous technological systems themselves. 

Every technological development is the result of choices. Choices made by governments, researchers, investors, consumers, manufacturers, distributors, users and many others. No technology is god-given or given by the "invisible hand of the market". No technology is unavoidable or unopposable. And no technology is neutral. DiEM25 believes that, as a society, we have the duty to be aware of the fact that we make choices on technology. Technology is therefore never value-free. The way we fund, adopt, use and regulate technology, or not, reflects society’s choice of its values and priorities. That is a reflection of our society’s priorities and values. We must be more aware of how choices around technology are rooted in values, and openly discuss and decide on them in a democratic way. The agenda setting of the debate around technology and values should be open, and not set by the technology industry itself. The necessary democratic instruments and institutions, capable to address the complexities of the democratisation of 21st century technologies, must be found. 

Every technology is the result of collaboration. Collaboration between developers, public institutions, users, researchers and more. Innovative societies foster collaborations. And they have public institutions and investments that foster the exchange of ideas and provide resources for the new to emerge - technologies depend on the public. For too long have regulations from the time of the first industrial revolution and power structures aided in monopolising and privatising technology. Artificial boundaries that block or slow down the creative sharing of technology damage society. The more value and technology are shared; the more they can create value in return. By sharing technology and knowledge, society ensures that much more value is created than by “protecting” it. DiEM25 firmly supports sharing technology, and rejects monopolies or rent seeking. With the growing importance of technological systems in the creation of value we need to devise ways to share the benefits of technology to all of society and to use it as a way to improve the lives of the many and not further boost the wealth of the few.

# Re:inventing a free, secure and decentralized internet

## European Data/Platform Autonomy

Those who are old enough to have experienced the INTERNET in the late 1990ies will remember how radical it felt to have a decentralized (rhizomatic) network of interconnected computers unaffected by the hegemonic discourse of traditional media outlets and arbitrary governmental control. This INTERNET and its accompanying promise of a new, progressive age of unlimited and uncontrolled communication is long gone. Instead the INTERNET has become a medieval marketplace where everyone is keen to sacrifice safety, responsibility and sustainability for a quick dime.  

We think that the progressive version of the INTERNET doesn't need to remain a nostalgic memory. In the last 20 years technologies and concepts have been developed that'll allow to facilitate a democratic, decentralized, less-commercialized, secure, anonymous and encrypted INTERNET. An INTERNET led and inspired by 21st century social and ethical standards.

In the conceivable future the INTERNET as we know it will spread even further into the private and public life of every human being. A development that is commonly referred to as Internet of Things. Its underlying protocol IPv6 is able to provide 340 sextillion IP-adresses. That is an unimaginable amount of quadrillions of microcomputers, each of which could be connected to all the others via the INTERNET. Yet another reason why we consider a structural change of the INTERNET to be of utmost importance.

We propose an evolutionary boost for the INTERNET which we want to achieve by sophisticated regulations and law amendments as well as publicly funded and facilitated structures that will allow european citizens to switch sides. And that will be there as a safety net when the old INTERNET has been altered unusable or unaffordable.   

The structures proposed on the following pages will also implement a reasonable business model to attract private investors without sacrificing the safety and data autonomy of the user/citizens.

### European Autonomous Data Network [P6](https://github.com/kmccurdy/techdsc/wiki/P6-European-Autonomous-Data-Network)

The basic structure for our next level INTERNET will be the European Autonomous Data Network (EADN). By proposing this we identify the centralized structure of the INTERNET as a main issue for its current deformation. Contemporary cloud computer services are oligopolistic, unsecure and privately controlled structural nodes that are harvesting our data. At the same time this centralized server structure provides a ready-made framework for government surveillance.

TL;DR: We are not safe on company servers.

As a solution we propose a decentralized, anonymous, autonomous, encrypted peer-to-peer-network. Think of a gigantic network of personal computers, tablets and smartphones helping to organize, structure and maintain a serverless and decentralized network. This network creates itself automatically with the initial help of bootstrap servers provided by the European Union. The data is stored on hardware and uses bandwith provided by users of the network. All data on this network is fragmented (split up into pieces of e.g. 1 MByte) and encrypted to ensure its safety and integrity. Popular Data is being spreaded increasingly to the physical location where it is required. No client has a complete overview over the network and thus the bigger the network becomes, the more secure it will get. To incentivize users to provided hardware and bandwidth there will be the option to implement a micropayment system (e.g. using a blockchain secured virtual currency).

To establish this European Autonomous Data Network we propose a European Save Networking Fund set up by the EU that funds research on an open-source and easy-to-use solution implementing the specifications mentioned above.

Furthermore we propose that the EU provides bootstrap servers and a minimum amount of storage capacity (storing encrypted data chunks) to get the network up and running.

To ensure the competitiveness of such a system further legislation might be necessary, both to ensure proof of competence as well as to prevent big players of distorting the decentralized structure of  the network.

### Platform independent and safe Social Media Infrastructure and Online Publishing [P1](https://github.com/kmccurdy/techdsc/wiki/P1-Suggestion-for-a-European-Progressive-Media-Fund)

We believe that internet users have the right to express their opinion and to reach people who like their opinion and to get updates on their favourite celebrities sexlife without being subject to surveillance and targeted advertising. Also we believe that internet users have the right to build a sustainable network of online contacts without having to trust an internet oligopolist on safeguarding their data. We need a system where it is safe for us to share whatever we want with our family and friends without the risk to share it with third parties. 

At present the opposite is the case: Information about personal characteristics and behaviors is linked, combined and utilized across companies, databases, platforms, devices, and services in real-time. Individuals are constantly surveyed and evaluated, categorized and grouped, rated and ranked, numbered and quantified, included or excluded,  and, as a result, treated differently. [P8](https://github.com/kmccurdy/techdsc/wiki/P8-Tech-Pillar-Suggestions-DSC-Lower-Austria)

While there are alternatives in place for nearly every service provided by an internet oligopolist (e.g. Mastodon, Diaspora etc.) it is next to impossible to gather a critical mass of users on any of those alternatives - and thus makes them insufficient as an alternative.

We think that as long as data vending and targeted advertising is the main kind of revenue in the online realm any effective solution will aways end up as a corrupted one. To prevent that and create the framework for the development of alternative social media and online content distribution systems we rely on two main principles:

- strong and effective legislation
- public funding for decentralised, encrypted and standardised solutions

To protect our data and to keep the internet a fun and safe place.

One of the technologies we consider as promising to reach the objective mentioned above is an online publish/subscribe tool (e.g. an API) that operates from the user's own computer or smartphone and is not depending on servers, is not exposing interests to other people than to the intended ones and is protecting the flow of information in transit. It would be mandatory for services like e.g. twitter and facebook to supply interfaces e.g. a uniform simple document upload format, so that user could safely access their user base without having to reveal more information than necessary. Nevertheless the final objective is a truly distributed and private social network.

##(waiting on comments by Claudio about the extent of this proposal, An existing document or container standard that supports your idea and  a legal policy that would make it mandatory for publishing platforms to accept a uniform simple document upload format)

To allow content producers to be rewarded for their work (be it art, text, image, video, music, podcast, live stream or whatever might come up in the future) we propose a mandatory anonymous micropayment system by which any content can be bought for a few cents. (See e.g. taler.net for an example) [P4](https://github.com/kmccurdy/techdsc/wiki/P4-Input-DSC-Vienna2) & Comments on that Proposal by Carlo von Lynx

Once those tools and accompanying legislation are implemented targeted advertising will become impossible and unnecessary while an effective and fair revenue system will replace it.

### Short-term measures 
[P9](https://github.com/kmccurdy/techdsc/wiki/P9-Questionnaire-submitted-by-Diego-Naranjo-(DiEM25-Belgium,-NC-member-and-Anna-Mazgal)) (& Accompanying e-mail communication)

As long as the measures outlined above are being developed and deployed we propose short-term measures to limit the damage that the current structure of the internet performs. Some of these short term measures have already been part of the original draft of the e-Privacy Regulation. The e-Privacy Regulation is meant to be the main framework to protect online communication and is currently being "watered down" by the European Council.

#### Privacy by design / Privacy by default
We are very concerned about  the de facto standard of insecure communications via unencrypted emails and messenger apps. Unauthorised access to a computer system is a crime under EU legislation (Directive 2013/40/EC). Following this logic we consider it unacceptable that unauthorised access to an individual’s computer system could be permitted by default.
We demand Privacy by design and Privacy by default as a mandatory standard for all hardware and software developed, sold and used in the EU.

Privacy by design means that all stages of the creation of the hardware and software incorporates a high level of protection of the users privacy. Privacy by default means that our devices and software are set to protect our data, with options to change this, if we wish.

Thereby we explicitly include the necessity to provide an incentive to develop technical solutions where citizens can provide location data to so called location-based-services without any privacy risks. Technical solutions based on local computation in the end-user’s device should always be preferred over centralised tracking.

#### Reasonable Regulation of User Consent 
Regarding User Consent we advocate a regulation that ensures that Software, Apps and Smart Devices are seeking for consent as user-friendly as possible and only for permissions that are crucial to perform their main task(s). Instead of being asked for general consent upon installation the user shall be asked to Opt-In for every task that the Software/App/Smart Device wishes to perform on their device. „All-or-Nothing“ consent - e.g. a mandatory general consent for the Software/App/Smart Device to function - is most likely NOT in accordance with the GDPR.

#### Communication Data / Metadata Protection
Communication Data (email, voice mail, chat, videoconference, VoIP) is sensitive data and there shall be no „legitimate interest“ exception to use this data without explicit user consent (see above). Metadata processed for security and QoS purposes should be anonymised as soon as possible and the storage of metadata should be limited to what is strictly necessary for the designated purpose. 

#### Tracking Regulation
To protect users against third party tracking, we demand that so-called cookie walls - notification windows that prevent access to a service if users do not agree to terms of service - should be prohibited. Also we embrace a prohibition of the common practice of excluding users that use ad-blocking or likewise protection software. We strongly demand this to be implemented asap to websites  that offer public services, services that are financed by public funds or medical services. 

#### Providers Disclosure Regarding Law Enforcement
Providers of electronic communication services should be obliged to publish all requests received by law enforcement agencies or comparable state agencies. This publication should include the number of requests received from law enforcement agencies, the legal justification invoked and the provider’s response in a meaningful aggregated format. We consider this to be a matter of public interest and transparency towards public authorities.
